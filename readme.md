# 911 Calls Data Capstone Project

## Overview

This project analyzes 911 call data to extract insights and trends from emergency service calls. The analysis covers various aspects, such as call types, geographic distribution, and time-based patterns, using Python and data visualization libraries.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project includes information on 911 emergency calls, such as:

- **Call types** (e.g., EMS, Fire, Traffic)
- **Location data** (latitude, longitude)
- **Timestamps** of the calls
- **Description** and **title** of the calls

## Key Features

- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing values and formatting data for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Identifying patterns and trends in the data through various visualizations.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Mapping the distribution of 911 calls by location.
- **Time Series Analysis**: Examining call volume trends over time.

## Results

This notebook provides several insights, including:

- The most common types of emergency calls.
- The busiest times for 911 calls.
- Geographical hot spots for emergency services.

## Future Work

- Expand the analysis to include predictive modeling.
- Further refine geospatial visualizations.
- Integrate real-time data analysis.
